            HOW GASSIFICATION TRUNS WASTE INTO ENERGY
        </h2>
        <p><b>*The better solutions is GASIFICATION- an old technology that advocates are trying to repurpose as a way to deal with the wastes.
            *Gasification companies don't burn trash, instead they turn into a synthetic gas, in a process they say is both economical and eco-friendly.</b>

        </h2>
        <p>
            <b>*Globally there are hundreds of gasification plants that generate electricity from fossil fuels like coal, but waste-to-energy gasification is a whole different trait. Even if the content changes, the generation will continue to take place which is an exciting option (USP).</b>
            <br>
            <br>
<b>*On December 2022, one of the major waste-to-energy gasification company  Waste Managment Pvt. Ltd. Energy closed its $33 million rupees. A funding round of vaporising trash. But, the thing that sets Sierra Energy from other companies is their age old technology method of blast furnaces which was used in iron and steel industry. But, about 10% of the waste material can’t be converted into gas which is converted into a stone that’s used in construction material. All the processes in Sierra energy and machineries don’t need external fuel because 20% of the energy created is used to run the plant itself.</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>*Another name in this industry that is, Breakthrough Energy Ventures partnered with Department of Defense to develop its small scale commercial facility at First hunter Leggitt in INDIA. This demo facility can handle 20 tons of waste per day.</b>
